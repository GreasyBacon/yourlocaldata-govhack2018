					Kingston has a rich Aboriginal history, and today we have a proud vibrant Aboriginal culture.

					The Boonwurrung people of past connected with the land and waterways in the area. Activities and campsites dependent on the seasons have left their evidence of middens and scarred trees throughout Kingston.  In good weather they camped along the foreshore while in poor weather they sought shelter in woodland or near rocks.

					Further inland lived the Wurundjeri-baluk clan of the Woiworung tribe. All these people belonged to a nation of Aboriginal people known as the Kulin nation who occupied most of Western and Central Victoria. A camping reserve was set up for the Boonwurrung at Mordialloc in the early 1840s and this site is now marked with the Aboriginal Flag flying beside the Mordialloc Creek.

				<p class="is-size-2">
					The City of Kingston was formed in December 1994 following the State Government’s major restructure of Local Government in Victoria. The new city was an amalgamation of all or parts of the former cities of Moorabbin, Mordialloc, Chelsea, Springvale and Oakleigh.
					At the time it was regarded as one of the most complex amalgamations in Victoria as it brought together such a diverse range of communities.

					In the intervening years the City of Kingston has developed into a vibrant and dynamic community. A new electoral structure for Kingston was announced in June 2007 and took effect following the Council elections on 29 November 2008.
